# Video-Game-Sales-Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard


Objective:
To analyze the sales performance of video games across different platforms, regions, and genres, and to understand the influence of ratings on global sales. The dashboard will help identify trends in video game sales and provide insights into which factors (platform, genre, rating, etc.) impact sales the most.


Problem Statement:
The video game industry is highly competitive, with multiple platforms, genres, and regional preferences driving sales.
It is challenging for game developers and publishers to predict which factors contribute most to high sales.
Understanding the influence of ratings, genre, and platform on global sales can help in optimizing game development and marketing strategies.
Regional sales trends and platform popularity differ, creating a need for detailed sales analysis by region.


Project Description:
This Power BI dashboard analyzes a Kaggle dataset of video game sales, covering multiple dimensions such as platforms, genres, publishers, and ratings.
The dashboard includes visualizations that explore:
Sales distribution across platforms to identify the most successful gaming consoles.
Regional sales performance for North America, Europe, Japan, and other markets.
Genre-wise sales analysis to highlight the most popular game categories.
Correlation between ratings and global sales, determining the impact of ratings on sales performance.
Publisher sales performance, showcasing the top publishers in the industry.
The dashboard enables game developers, publishers, and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve future sales and marketing strategies.
